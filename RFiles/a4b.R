# In this code, we use the aggregate function to calculate the average yield per block for the soil treated with nitrogen (N = 1) and for the soil that did not receive nitrogen (N = 0). We then use the ggplot2 package to make a grouped bar chart showing the average yield per block for the two groups, with the x-axis representing the block and the y-axis representing the average yield per plot in pounds. The fill argument is used to group the bars by whether or not nitrogen was applied, and the position argument is used to place the bars side by side. We also add appropriate axis labels, a title, and a legend.

# The purpose of taking the factor block into account is to control for any variability in yield that may be due to the location of the plots within each block. By comparing the average yield per block between the two groups (N = 1 and N = 0), we can see whether there is a difference in yield that is due to the application of nitrogen or to other factors, such as differences in soil conditions or weather.
